<h2 id="apt-package-management">APT package management</h2>
<p>APT is an acronym for <strong>A</strong>dvanced
<strong>P</strong>ackaging <strong>T</strong>ool and provides a
collection of programs and scripts that assist the system and
administrator in installing and managing Debian packages.<br />
A complete description of the APT system can be found in <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPackageManagement">Debian’s
APT-HOWTO</a>.</p>
<h3 id="apt-and-apt-get">apt and apt-get</h3>
<p><strong>apt</strong> is intended as an end-user interface and,
compared to more specialized tools such as apt-get and apt-cache,
enables some options more suitable for interactive use by default. With
apt not all options of apt-get and apt-cache are available. Please read
the man pages of apt, apt-get, and apt-cache. The following table shows
the respective commands and their basic meaning.</p>

<h3 id="sources.list---list-of-sources">sources.list - List of
sources</h3>
<p>The APT system needs a configuration file which contains information
about the location of installable and upgradeable packages. In general,
this file is called sources.list. Modern systems use modularized sources
now to improve the overview.</p>
<p>siduction provides the sources in this folder:</p>
<p><code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/</code></p>
<p>Inside this directory you can find the following files by
default:</p>
<p><code>debian.list</code><br />
<code>extra.list</code><br />
<code>fixes.list</code></p>
<p>This has the advantage that it is easier to automatically select from
mirror servers (“mirror switching”), and it also makes it easier to add
or replace source lists.</p>
<p>Custom source list files can be added with the naming<br />
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/xxxx.list</code>.<br />
For example, on siduction<br />
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/extra.list</code> might look like
this:</p>
<pre><code>This is the default mirror, chosen at first boot.
# One might consider to choose the geographically nearest
 or the fastest mirror.
 
deb http://packages.siduction.org/extra unstable main contrib non-free

#deb-src http://packages.siduction.org/extra unstable main contrib non-free</code></pre>
<p>Under <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/fixes.list</code> it might look
like this:</p>
<pre><code>deb https://packages.siduction.org/fixes unstable main contrib non-free

#deb-src https://packages.siduction.org/fixes unstable main contrib non-free</code></pre>
<p>And <code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code> contains the
actual Debian repo:</p>
<pre><code># debian loadbalancer
deb http://deb.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free

#deb-src http://deb.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free</code></pre>
<p>More entries for optional siduction repositories can be found at <a
href="https://packages.siduction.org/">siduction repositories</a>.</p>
<p>For example, adding one or more Debian repositories would look like
this:</p>
<pre><code>#Debian
#Unstable
deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free

#deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ unstable main contrib non-free

# Testing
#deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free

#deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ testing main contrib non-free

# Experimental
#deb http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ experimental main contrib non-free

#deb-src http://ftp.us.debian.org/debian/ experimental main contrib non-free</code></pre>
<p><em>NOTE:</em><br />
This example uses the US Debian mirror starting with ftp.us. This
setting can be changed as <strong>root</strong> by adjusting the country
code (for example: ftp.at, ftp.de). Most countries have local Debian
mirrors available. This provides a higher connection speed for the user
and also saves bandwidth.</p>

<h3 id="apt-update">apt update</h3>
<p>To get updated information about the packages, a database is kept
with the needed entries. The apt program uses it when installing a
package to resolve all dependencies and thus to guarantee that the
selected packages will work. The creation or update of this database is
done with the command <strong><code>apt update</code></strong>.</p>

<p>In the last case, the configuration files are not removed from the

<p>The packages listed here were removed without purging.</p>
<h3 id="hold-or-downgrade-a-package">Hold or downgrade a package</h3>
<p>Sometimes it may be necessary to revert to an earlier version of a
package because the latest version has a serious bug.</p>
<p><strong>Hold</strong></p>
<p>With <code>apt-mark</code>, apt allows you to apply various settings
for a package. The <code>hold</code> option protects the package from
changes by apt.</p>
<pre><code>apt-mark hold &lt;package_name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>To end the holding of a package:</p>
<pre><code>apt-mark unhold &lt;package_name&gt;</code></pre>
<p>This is how to search for packages that are placed on hold:</p>
<pre><code>apt-mark showhold</code></pre>
<p>Please keep in mind that hold is only an emergency measure. You will
run into problems if you forget to release a hold in a timely manner.
This is even more true the more (essential) dependencies the package
has. So please use holds only in case of emergency and release them as
soon as possible.</p>
<p><strong>Downgrade</strong></p>
<p>Debian does not support package downgrading. In simple cases,
installing older versions can succeed, but it can also fail
spectacularly. For more information, see the Emergency downgrading
chapter in the Debian Handbook.</p>
<p>Although downgrading is not supported, it can succeed for simple
packages. The steps for a downgrade are now demonstrated on the package
kmahjongg:</p>
<p>The sources of unstable are stored in<br />
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code><br />
with a hash sign “#” and add the sources for testing. After that, we
execute the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>apt update
apt install kmahjongg/testing</code></pre>
<p>The now installed package is set to hold in order to protect it from
upgrades:</p>
<pre><code>apt-mark hold kmahjongg</code></pre>
<p>Then the sources for testing are marked with a hash “#” in<br />
<code>/etc/apt/sources.list.d/debian.list</code>,<br />
while the hashes in front of the sources for unstable are removed again.
After saving the changes, enter:</p>
<pre><code>apt update</code></pre>
<p>As soon as a new, bug-free package arrives in sid, you can reinstall
the latest version if you exit the hold state:</p>
<pre><code>apt-mark unhold kmahjongg
apt update
apt install kmahjongg / apt full-upgrade</code></pre>
<h3 id="updating-the-system">Updating the system</h3>
<p>An upgrade of the whole system is performed with this command:
<strong><code>apt full-upgrade</code></strong>. Before such an action,
the current upgrade warnings on the main siduction page should be
followed to check whether packages of one’s own system are affected. If
an installed package should be kept, i.e. put on hold, please refer to
the section <a
href="./sys-admin-apt_en.html#hold-or-downgrade-a-package">downgrade or
“hold”</a> of a package.</p>
<p>A simple <strong><code>apt upgrade</code></strong> of Debian Sid is
usually not recommended. However, it can be helpful if there is a
situation with many packages held or to be removed. Here an
<strong><code>apt upgrade</code></strong> can update packages not
affected by the situation.</p>
<p>How regularly should a system upgrade be performed?<br />
A system update should be performed regularly, every one to two weeks
has proven to be a good guideline. Even monthly system updates should
not cause any significant problems. Theoretically, the system can be
updated several times a day after mirror synchronization every 6
hours.</p>
<p>Experience shows that you should not wait longer than two, maximum
three months. Special attention should be paid to program packages which
do not come from the siduction or Debian repositories or which have been
compiled by yourself, as they may lose their functionality after a
system update via full-upgrade due to incompatibilities.</p>
<p><strong>Update not with live media</strong></p>
<p>There is no possibility to update a siduction installation using a
live medium. Below we describe in detail the upgrade process and why apt
should be used.</p>
<h3 id="updateable-packages">Updateable packages</h3>
<p>After updating the internal database, you can find out for which
packages a newer version exists (first you need to install
apt-show-versions):</p>
<pre><code>root@siduction# apt-show-versions -u
libpam-runtime/unstable upgradeable from 0.79-1 to 0.79-3
passwd/unstable upgradeable from 1:4.0.12-5 to 1:4.0.12-6
teclasat/unstable upgradeable from 0.7m02-1 to 0.7n01-1
libpam-modules/unstable upgradeable from 0.79-1 to 0.79-3
[...]</code></pre>
<p>The same can be achieved with:</p>
<pre><code>apt list --upgradable</code></pre>
<p>The upgrade of a single package (here e.g. debtags-1.6.6.0) can be
done considering the dependencies with:</p>
<pre><code>root@siduction# apt install debtags-1.6.6.0

<p>After downloading the packages with <code>full-upgrade -d</code>,
they can be installed at any time according to the procedure in the
following paragraph.</p>
<h3 id="run-full-upgrade">Run full-upgrade</h3>
<p class="warning">
<strong>Warning:</strong> <br />A system update that is not performed in
the multi-user.target (formerly runlevel 3) can lead to problems when it
comes to updates of the installed desktop environment or the X server!
</p>
<p>Before updating the system, visit the <a
href="https://forum.siduction.org/">siduction home page</a> to find out
about any upgrade warnings. These warnings are necessary because of the
structure of Debian sid/unstable which adds new program packages to its
repositories several times a day.</p>
<p>The following procedure should be followed:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Log out of the desktop environment.<br />
(This procedure is nowadays only recommended when updating X or the
desktop environment itself, but does not hurt in other cases.)<br />
</li>
<li>Switch to the text console with
<strong><code>Ctrl</code></strong>+<strong><code>Alt</code></strong>+<strong><code>F2</code></strong>.</li>
<li>Log in as <strong>root</strong>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then execute the following commands:</p>
<pre><code>init 3
apt update
apt full-upgrade
apt clean
init 5 &amp;&amp; exit</code></pre>
<p>If a new kernel has been installed, the command
<strong><code>systemctl reboot</code></strong> or
<strong><code>init 6</code></strong> needs to be run instead of
<em>“init 5”</em> in order to boot with the new kernel.</p>
<h3 id="why-use-apt-exclusively">Why use apt exclusively</h3>
<p>For installing, deleting, and carrying out a system update,
<em>apt</em> should be used. Please refrain from updating the system
with applications like <code>synaptic</code>, <code>adept</code>, or
<code>kpackage</code>!</p>
<p>The mentioned programs are excellent <em>Debian stable</em>
installation and very good for searching program packages, but they are
not adapted to the special tasks of the dynamic distribution Debian Sid.
They cannot correctly resolve the extensive changes in Sid (changed
dependencies, naming conventions, or scripts). This is not due errors in
the programs or mistakes by the developers.</p>
<p>Package managers like adept, synaptic, and kpackage are - technically
speaking - non-deterministic. When using a dynamic distribution like
Debian Sid with the addition of third party repositories whose quality
cannot be tested by the Debian team, a system update can lead to
disaster, as these package managers can make wrong decisions by
automatically trying to solve the problem.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it should be noted that all GUI package managers must be
run in X. System updates in X (even an anyway not recommended ‘apt
upgrade’) will sooner or later cause you to irreversibly damage your
system.</p>
<p>In contrast, apt does only what is requested. In the case of
incomplete dependencies in Sid, i.e. when the system breaks (this can
happen in Sid during structural changes), the causes can be precisely
determined and thus repaired or bypassed. The own system does not
“break”. So if a system update feels like deleting half the system, apt
leaves it up to the administrator to decide what to do, and does not act
on its own.</p>
<p>This is the reason why Debian builds use apt and not other package
managers.</p>
<h3 id="searching-for-program-packages">Searching for program
packages</h3>
<p>The APT system provides a number of useful search commands that
search the APT database and output information about packages. In
addition, there are some programs that display the search
graphically.</p>
<p><strong>Package search in the terminal</strong></p>
<p>With the simple command<br />
<strong><code>apt search &lt;search_pattern&gt;</code></strong><br />
you get a list of all packages containing the search pattern. Searching
with <code>search</code> allows the use of regex terms.</p>
<p>For example, if you search for <em>“gman”</em>, you get this
result:</p>
<pre><code>user1@pc1:~$ apt search ^gman
Sorting... Done
Full text search... Done
gman/unstable,now 0.9.3-5.3 amd64 [installed]
  small man(1) front-end for X

gmanedit/unstable 0.4.2-7 amd64
  GTK+/GNOME editor for manual pages</code></pre>
<p>Here the “^” means that “gman” must be at the beginning of the line.
Without this character, the pattern will also find khan<em>gman</em> and
lo<em>gman</em>ager, for example.</p>
<p>If you want more information about the current versions of a package,
use:</p>

Description: small man(1) front-end for X
 Gman is a simple front-end for the manual page system. The
 most basic job of gman is to build a database for all the
 man pages and display them (or part of them) on the screen.
 When user decides to read a man page, gman will launch an
 external viewer to display the manual page. More than one
 external viewer windows can be launched at the same time.
[...]</code></pre>
<p>All installable versions of the package (depending on the
sources.list) can be listed as follows:</p>
<pre><code>user1@pc1:~$ apt list gman
listing... Done
gman/unstable,now 0.9.3-5.3 amd64 [installed]</code></pre>
<p>The command <strong><code>aptitude</code></strong> (in the terminal)
opens the program of the same name in an ncurses environment. It is
operated with the keyboard or mouse and offers various functions which
can be reached via the upper menu bar. The use of APT or Aptitude is a
matter of taste, but Aptitude is often “too smart” for the speed of
Debian Unstable.</p>

<p><strong>Graphical package search</strong></p>
<p>The program <strong><code>packagesearch</code></strong> is very
useful to search for suitable programs. Mostly packagesearch is not
installed automatically; therefore:</p>
<pre><code>apt update
apt install packagesearch</code></pre>
<p>After the first start of packagesearch you have to select “apt” in
<em>“Packagesearch”</em> &gt; <em>“Preferences”</em> and occasionally an
info window appears, which criticizes the absence of deborphan. Please
use the information from deborphan with utmost caution.</p>
<p>Packagesearch is not intended to be used for installing
files/packages, but only as a graphical search engine. Upgrading and
reinstalling files without first quitting X can cause problems (see
above).</p>
<p>The following search criteria are available:</p>
<ul>
<li>pattern (general search query)</li>
<li>tags (search based on debtags)</li>
<li>files (file names)</li>
<li>installed status</li>
<li>orphaned packages</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition, a lot of information about Debian packages is provided,
including which files are bundled in a package. More detailed
information about using packagesearch can be found at <em>“Help”</em>
&gt; <em>“Contents”</em>. Currently the user interface of packagesearch
is English only.</p>
<p>A complete description of the APT system can be found in <a
href="https://wiki.debian.org/DebianPackageManagement">Debian’s
APT-HOWTO</a>.</p>
