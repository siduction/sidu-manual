<p><strong>“Standing on the Shoulders of Giants”</strong></p>
<p>The siduction team is very proud to present an unscheduled release
for a special occasion. Debian GNU/Linux, whose unstable branch some of
us have been following for over 20 years, celebrates its thirtieth
birthday on 8/16/2023 and we think that is worthy of all honor.</p>
<p>Debian is the second oldest distribution after Slackware, and is
solely supported by the people involved, without a company standing in
the background or someone at the top deciding where things go. Debian is
considered the “universal operating system” because of the many
architectures supported to this day, and the stability of their releases
is legendary.</p>
<h3 id="changing-history">Changing history</h3>
<p>The story began on August 16, 1993, when Ian Murdock introduced his
self-designed system “Debian Linux Release”. The <a
href="https://www.debian.org/doc/manuals/project-history/manifesto.de.html">Debian
Manifesto</a> followed that same year. The first stable version, 1.1,
was released in 1996, then compiled by under 100 developers. The release
was codenamed “Buzz”, a first reference to the characters from the movie
franchise Toy Story, from which the codenames are still borrowed
today.</p>
<p>So far, another 16 releases have been added, the current of which is
codenamed “Bookworm” and was released on June 10, 2023. The motto is
still: It will be released when it is ready.</p>
<p>In 1997 already about 400 developers agreed on the Debian social
contract as an important document, which has been edited only twice
since its existence and which states under clause 1: <strong>Debian will
remain 100% free</strong>. At the same time, the “Debian Free Software
Guidelines” (DFSG) were adopted as part of this contract.</p>
<h3 id="self-managed">Self-managed</h3>
<p>Debian administers itself in the form of a do-ocracy. Today, the
approximately 1,000 developers determine their tasks independently and
responsibly. That this is not always easy among a thousand creative
people should be clear to everyone. This is reminded, among other
things, of upheavals such as the introduction of systemd, which brought
Debian to its breaking point. The inclusion of non-free firmware on the
distribution’s installation media was also hotly debated in 2022. The
discussions about this dragged on for years.</p>
<p>To the outside world, Debian often appears to be at odds with one
another, as upcoming decisions are often the subject of heated debate.
In the end, however, the project seems to emerge stronger from such
phases. This reliability may also be a reason why more derivatives are
based on Debian than on any other distribution. Currently <a
href="https://distrowatch.com/search.php?ostype=All&amp;category=All&amp;origin=All&amp;basedon=Debian&amp;notbasedon=None&amp;desktop=All&amp;architecture=All&amp;package=All&amp;rolling=All&amp;isosize=All&amp;netinstall=All&amp;language=All&amp;defaultinit=All&amp;status=Active#simple">122
active distributions</a> use Debian as a base. Among them are such
pioneering distributions as Knoppix or Ubuntu. If you add distributions
that are no longer active, the number rises to 414. Impressive!</p>
<p><strong>It all started with Knoppix</strong></p>
<p>Our own timeline starts with Knoppix and went from Kanotix to sidux
and aptosid to siduction, which we have been shipping for 12 years now.
Debian has never failed us, but the decision making process has
sometimes been a bit too slow. For example, we introduced systemd before
Debian, and we have been shipping firmware as an option for some time to
support current hardware on the installation media.</p>
<p>But otherwise siduction is probably 98% Debian Unstable. We thank you
for that and wish the Proj́ekt at least 30 more years. Standing on the
Shoulders of Giants.</p>

<p>First of all, a new wallpaper by artist <a
href="https://www.artstation.com/angevere">Angevere</a> (Ona Kristensen)
awaits you, which we may use with kind permission.</p>
<h3 id="the-flavours">The Flavours</h3>
<p>The flavours we offer for siduction 2023.1.0 are KDE Plasma 5.27.7.1,
LXQt 1.3.0, Xfce 4.18, Xorg and noX. GNOME, MATE and Cinnamon did not
make it again this time because there is no maintainer within siduction
for them. If you are interested, please get in touch. They may or may
not come back at some point. Of course they are still installable from
the repository.</p>
<p>The released images of siduction 2023.1.0 are a snapshot of Debian
Unstable, also named Sid, from Aug. 14, 2023, enriched with some useful
packages and scripts, a Calamares-based installer and a customized
version of the Linux kernel 6.4-10, while systemd is at 254.1-2.</p>
<h3 id="non-free-and-contrib">Non-free and Contrib</h3>
<p>The following non-free and contrib packages are installed by
default:</p>
<p><strong>Nonfree:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>amd64-microcode - Processor microcode firmware for AMD CPUs<br />
</li>
<li>firmware-amd-graphics - Binary firmware for AMD/ATI graphics
chips<br />
</li>
<li>firmware-atheros - Binary firmware for Atheros wireless cards<br />

</li>
<li>firmware-zd1211 - binary firmware for the zd1211rw wireless

</li>
<li>intel-microcode - Processor microcode firmware for Intel CPUs</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Contrib:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>b43-fwcutter - utility for extracting Broadcom 43xx firmware<br />
</li>
<li>firmware-b43-installer - firmware installer for the b43 driver<br />
</li>
<li>firmware-b43legacy-installer - firmware installer for the b43legacy
driver<br />
</li>
<li>iucode-tool - Intel processor microcode</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Remove Non-Free Content</strong></p>
<p>Currently, the installer does not offer the possibility to deselect
packages that do not comply with the DFSG, the Debian Free Software
Guidelines. This means that packages such as non-free firmware are
installed on the system by default. The vrms command will list these
packages for you. You can manually uninstall unwanted packages or remove
them all by typing apt purge $(vrms -s) before or after installation.
Otherwise, our remove-nonfree script can do this for you later.</p>
<h3 id="installation-notes-and-known-issues">Installation notes and
known issues</h3>
<p>If you want to reuse an existing home partition (or any other data
partition), you should do this after installation and not in the
Calamares installer. While it will work, it is more robust to add it
afterwards.<br />
With some Intel graphics processors on some devices, the system may
freeze shortly after booting into Live. To fix this, you must set the
kernel parameter <code>intel_iommu=igfx_off</code> before rebooting.</p>
<h3 id="many-thanks-to-all-involved">Many thanks to all involved</h3>
<p>We would like to thank you, all the testers and all the people who
have supported us over the years. This release is also thanks to you. We
would also like to thank the birthday boy Debian, as this means we stand
on the shoulders of giants.<br />
And now have fun!</p>
<p>On behalf of the siduction team:</p>
