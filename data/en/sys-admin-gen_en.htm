				<h3>insserv : To start/stop already installed services:</h3>
							<p><span class="highlight-2">Read <span class="highlight-3">/usr/share/doc/insserv/README.Debian</span>, the release notes and the man pages carefully:</span></p>
<pre>
 $ man insserv
 $ man invoke-rc.d
 $ man update-rc.d
 google LSB headers
</pre>

							<p>For 'start':</p>

<pre>
/etc/init.d/&lt;service&gt; start
</pre>
							<p>For 'stop':</p>
<pre>
/etc/init.d/&lt;service&gt; stop
</pre>
							<p>For 'restart':</p>
<pre>
/etc/init.d/&lt;service&gt; restart
</pre>
							<p>To prevent services running at-startup:</p>
<pre>
update-rc.d &lt;service&gt; remove
[will remove all startup links]
</pre>
							<p>To set a service to default value at boot [not necessarily required]:</p>
<pre>
update-rc.d &lt;service&gt; defaults
[will make missing startup links]
</pre>

							<p>To read the current list of services with default values:</p>
<pre>
ls /etc/rc5.d
</pre>

							<p><span class="highlight-3">S</span> means the service will start in runlevel 5.<br />
							<span class="highlight-3">K</span> means service will not start (manual override).</p>

			<h2>Boot-Up Manager (bum) - Graphical services configuration tool</h2>

							<p>If the logic of a debian system boot up sequence is not very clear and familiar to you, you should not play with symlinks, permissions and so forth. In order to avoid messing up your system. Boot-Up Manager will help you to automate your configuration.</p>

							<p>Boot-Up Manager is a GUI runlevel configuration editor which allows  you to configure what init services are invoked when the system boots up or reboots.  It displays a list of every service which could be started at boot.  You can toggle individual services on and off.</p>

<pre>
apt-get install bum
</pre>
							<p>To use the Boot-Up Manager GUI:</p>
<pre>
$ sux
password:
bum
</pre>

			<h2>Killing a service or process</h2>
						<p><span class="highlight-3">pkill</span> is very useful as its human readable and can work in both user and root mode in the terminal or at tty</p>
<pre>
pkill -n service
</pre>
						<p>If you are not sure of the correct spelling of the process or service you wish to kill <span class="highlight-3">pkill &lt;tab&gt; &lt;tab&gt;</span> will provide a list </p>

						<p>htop is also good a alternative. (killall -9 is your last alternative).</p>

							<p>To ascertain the runlevel (init) you are currently in:</p>
<pre>
who -r
</pre>
							<p>Required reading for any siduction and Debian system administrator regarding runlevels:</p>
<pre>
man init
</pre>

	</div>
	<div class="divider" id="pw-lost">
		<h2>Lost root passwords</h2>

							<p>You cannot recover a lost password but you can set a new one.</p>

							<p>First boot from the Live-CD.</p>

							<p>As root mount your root partition (for example /dev/sdb2)</p>

<pre>
mount /dev/sdb2 /media/sdb2
</pre>
							<p>Now chroot into your old root-Partition with and set a new password:</p>
<pre>
chroot /media/sdb2 passwd
</pre>

	<div class="divider" id="pw-new">
		<h2>Setting new passwords</h2>

							<p>To change your 'user' password, as <span class="highlight-3">$ user</span>:</p>
<pre>
$ passwd
</pre>

							<p>To change your 'root' password, as <span class="highlight-3"># root</span>:</p>
<pre>
passwd
</pre>

							<p>To change a user's password as an administrator, as <span class="highlight-3"># root</span>:</p>

			<h2>Fonts in siduction</h2>
				<h5>Correct dpi settings - Basic Philosophy</h5>

							<p>DPI settings are problematic to guess, but are actually perfectly done by X.</p>

				<h5>Correct resolutions and refresh rates</h5>

							<p>Every monitor has its own perfect settings combination, but unfortunately not all of them report the right DCC values, and sometimes it is in need of a manual overwride.</p>

				<!--<h5>Correct graphics adapter drivers</h5>

							<p>Some newer ATI and Nvidia cards simply don't play well with the free Xorg drivers, and the only reasonable solution in such case are the commercial closed source drivers. siduction will not  pre-install those for legal reasons, <a href="gpu-en.htm#foss-xorg"> The solutions can be found here. </a></p>-->

				<h5>Default Font selections, rendering and sizes</h5>

							<p>siduction uses (Debian) pre-selected free fonts which have proved to be very balanced, your own fonts selection can/may deteriorate the quality of rendering. But there are a few powerful options in Debian (apart from KDE>systemsettings ) that can help providing spotless rendering with other fonts as well. But please be aware that every font has just a few real perfect sizes, other sizes may not play well.</p>

							<p>Playing with the dpi size with the command may also be of assistance:</p>
<pre>
fix-dpi-kdm
</pre>
							<p>It should show the DPI for your screensize, but you can play with that as well.You will need to go to init 3 and back to init 5 to make it work or do a reboot.</p>

							<p> After having changed font type or DPI (in X or Firefox/Iceweasel), you might need some readjustments to get results to your liking, especially. after a change from Bitmap Fonts to True Type Fonts or the other way round through:</p>
<pre>
dpkg-reconfigure fontconfig-config
</pre>
							<p>Choose native and autohinter on automatic. Otherwise play around with it.</p>

							<p>Should you need to rebuild your font cache:</p>
<pre>
fc-cache -f -vv
</pre>
							<p>If that does not work you might need to reinstall the package with a default config file of your fonts cache by:</p>

<pre>
apt-get install --reinstall --yes -o DPkg::Options::=--force-confmiss -o DPkg::Options::=--force-confnew fontconfig fontconfig-config
</pre>

				<h5>GTK based applications like Firefox/Iceweasel</h5>
							<p>GTK-based apps in general are problematic with KDE defaults. This could be solved by this:</p>
<pre>
apt-get install gtk2-engines system-config-gtk-kde gtk-qt-engine gtk2-engines-qtcurve
</pre>
							<p>In <span class="highlight-3">System Settings >Appearance </span> you will have a new menu item called <span class="highlight-3">GTK Styles and Fonts</span>. Set 'GTK Styles' to use 'Cleanlooks' and have the 'GTK Fonts' set to use 'KDE fonts' <span class="highlight-3">or </span> experiment with the various options to suit your preferences.</p>

							<p>This MAY fix your font rendering in gtk apps.</p>

	</div>
	<div class="divider" id="cups">
			<h2>CUPS</h2>
							<p>KDE has a large section inbuilt in the KDE help, however dist-upgrades often can cause cups to misbehave, this is one known solution,:</p>

<pre>
modprobe lp
echo lp >> /etc/modules
apt-get purge cupsys cups
apt-get install cups
        OR
apt-get install cups printer-driver-gutenprint hplip
</pre>
							<p>Make sure CUPS is running:</p>
<pre>
/etc/init.d/cups restart
</pre>

							<p> Then in a web browser: </p>
<pre>
http://localhost:631
</pre>

							<p>Another gotcha is when setting up cups via the GUI method, is that it brings up a dialog box asking for you to put in your password, however the dialog box has your user name, prefilled, so when you put in your user password, it does not work, What is really wants is for you to change the user name to <span class="highlight-2">root</span> and put in your <span class="highlight-2">root password</span>.</p>

							<p><a href="http://www.linuxfoundation.org/collaborate/workgroups/openprinting/database/databaseintro">The OpenPrinting database</a> contains a wealth of information about specific printers, along with extensive driver information, the drivers themselves, basic specifications, and an associated set of configuration tools. </p>


	</div>
	<div class="divider" id="sound">
			<h2>Sound in siduction</h2>
							<p><span class="highlight-3">Sound is muted by default in siduction.</span></p>

							<p>The KDE version uses Kmix and XFCE uses Mixer.</p>

							<p>Often it is only a matter of clicking on the sound icon in the taskbar and unchecking the 'Mute box'.</p>

					<h6>Kmix</h6>
							<p>In Kmix you will need to activate the options you prefer for channel options, <span class="highlight-3">Kmix>Setting>Configure Channels.</span> Or in a terminal:</p>
<pre>
$ kmix
</pre>

					<h6>XFCE</h6>

							<p>In XFCE run the mixer application and add some controls via the <span class="highlight-3"> Multimedia>Mixer</span> and click the <span class="highlight-3">Select Controls box.</span> Or in a terminal:</p>
<pre>
$ xfce4-mixer
</pre>

					<h3>Alsamixer</h3>

							<p>If you prefer to use Alsamixer, it is in the alsa-utils package:</p>
<pre>
apt-get update
apt-get install alsa-utils
exit
</pre>
							 <p>Set your preferred sound settings as <span class="highlight-2">$user</span> from the terminal:</p>
<pre>
$ alsamixer
</pre>
