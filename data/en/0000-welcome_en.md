# Welcome

## The siduction™ GNU/Linux operating system

The name **siduction** is a play on two words: the word **sid**, meaning the code name of Debian Unstable, and **seduction**.

siduction is an operating system based on the [Linux kernel](https://kernel.org) and the [GNU project](https://gnu.org). In addition there are application programs from [Debian](https://debian.org). siduction is committed to the core values of the [Debian Social Contract](https://www.debian.org/social_contract.en.html) and the following "*Debian Free Software Guidelines*".  
See also [DFSG](https://ee.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Free_Software_Guidelines)

### General

For those who want to get started quickly, here is the [Quick Start Guide](0100-wel-quickstart_en.md#quickstart)

The siduction operating system manual is a reference for getting to know the system as well as for refreshing your knowledge of the system. It not only provides basic knowledge, but also covers complex topics and supports the work as an administrator of siduction systems.

It is divided into similar topics: Everything concerning partitioning, for example, is in the "Installation/Partitioning" chapter, and topics concerning WiFi are in the "Network" chapter.

Printing manual pages:  
Linux commands can be more than 120 characters long. In order to optimize the display on a screen, automatic line breaks are not applied. Our manual in PDF format, on the other hand, contains line breaks for the long commands. The PDF manual is available on all ISOs and on the system after installation.  
To print manual pages, please use the PDF and print only the pages you need.

To get help for a specific pre-installed or self-installed application program (also called a package), it is best to consult the FAQs, online manuals or forums on the home page, or the application's help menu.

Almost all application programs offer assistance by means of an associated "*Manual-Page*" (short manpage). It can be called in the terminal using the command **`man <package_name>`**. You can also check for documentation in the `/usr/share/doc/<packagename>` directory.
