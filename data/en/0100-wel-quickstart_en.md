## siduction Quick Start Guide

siduction strives to be 100% compatible with Debian Sid. Nevertheless, siduction may provide packages that temporarily replace buggy Debian packages. The siduction apt repository contains siduction specific packages like the siduction kernel, scripts, packages we would like to push to Debian, utilities, and documentation.

### Essential chapters

> Some chapters of the manual are essential reading for users who are new to Linux or new to siduction. In addition to this brief introduction, these are:

+ [Terminal/Console](0701-term-konsole_en.md#terminal---command-line) - describes how to use a terminal and the `su` command.

+ [Partitioning the hard disk](0312-part-gparted_en.md#partitioning-with-gparted) - describes how to partition a hard disk. 

+ [Downloading siduction ISO](0206-iso-dl_en.md#downloading-the-iso) - describes how to download and check a siduction ISO file.

+ [ISO to USB stick - memory card](0207-iso-to-usb-sd_en.md#iso-to-usb-stick---memory-card) - Describes how to create a siduction life media.

+ [Installation on a hard disk](0301-hd-install_en.md#installation-on-hdd) - describes how to install siduction onto a hard disk.

+ [Non-free drivers, firmware, and sources](0600-gpu_en.md#graphics-drivers) - describes how software sources can be adapted and non-free firmwares can be installed.

+ [Internet connection](0500-network_en.md#network) - describes how to connect to the Internet.

+ [Package Manager and System Update](0705-sys-admin-apt_en.md#apt-package-management) - describes how to install new software and update the system.

### About the stability of Debian Sid

'Sid' is the name of Debian's unstable repository. Debian Sid is regularly updated with new software packages, which means that this Debian distribution contains the latest versions of the respective programs in a very timely manner. However, this also means that there is less time between a release in the upstream (by the software developers) and the distribution in Debian Sid to test the packages.

### The siduction kernel

The Linux kernel of siduction is optimized to achieve the following goals: problem solving, enhanced and updated features, performance optimization, higher stability. The basis is always the latest kernel from [http://www.kernel.org/](https://www.kernel.org/). 

### The management of software packages

siduction follows Debian rules regarding package structure and uses `apt` as well as `dpkg` for software package management. The Debian and siduction repositories are located in `/etc/sources.list.d/*`. 

Debian siduction contains more than 20,000 program packages, so the chances of finding a program suitable for a task are very good. Information on how to search for program packages can be found here:  
[Search program packages](0705-sys-admin-apt_en.md#searching-for-program-packages) .

A program package is installed with this command:

~~~
apt install <package_name>
~~~

See also: [Install new packages](0705-sys-admin-apt_en.md#install-packages).

New and updated software packages are pushed to Debian Sid Repositories four times a day. Quick package management is achieved by using a local database. The command

~~~
apt update
~~~

is necessary before each installation of a new software package to synchronize the local database with the repositories' software supply.

**The use of other Debian based repositories, sources, and RPMs**.  
Installations from source code are not supported. It is recommended to compile as user (not root) and to place the application in the home directory without installing it onto the system. The use of `checkinstall` to generate DEB packages should be limited to purely private use. Conversion programs for RPM packages like `alien` are not recommended either.

Other well-known (and lesser-known) Debian based distributions create new packages with a structure different from Debian. They often use other directories for programs, scripts, and files during installation, which can lead to unstable systems. Some packages cannot be installed at all because of unresolvable dependencies, different naming conventions, or different versioning. For example, a different version of glibc may result in the inability to execute any program at all.

For this reason, Debian's repositories should be used to install the required software packages. Other software sources may be difficult or impossible to support by siduction. This includes packages and PPAs from Ubuntu.

### Updating the system - upgrade

An upgrade can only be performed when X graphics server is stopped. To stop the graphics server, the following command can be entered into a console as **root**:

~~~
init 3
~~~

After that, system updates can be performed safely. First, refresh the local package database with

~~~
apt update
~~~

Then update the system with one of the two alternatives

~~~
apt upgrade
apt full-upgrade
~~~

Afterwards, start the graphical user interface with the following command:

~~~
init 5
~~~

**apt full-upgrade** is the recommended procedure to upgrade a siduction installation to the latest version. It is described in more detail here:  
[Updating an installed system - full-upgrade](0705-sys-admin-apt_en.md#updating-the-system).

### Network configuration

The **Networkmanager** integrated in all graphical interfaces of siduction offers a quick configuration of network cards (Ethernet and wireless). It is mostly self-explanatory. In the terminal, the script **nmcli** provides access to the netwokmanagers functionality.  
Wireless networks are scanned. You can connect to the networks found and make settings for the encryption method, the IPv4 or IPv6 Internet protocol, and a proxy server. The backend is `iwd`. Ethernet configuration is done automatically when using a DHCP server on the router (dynamic assignment of an IP address), but manual setup (from netmasks to nameservers) is also possible with this script.

In the graphical user interface, the network manager is located in the taskbar.  
The start command in the console is **`nmcli`** or **`nmtui`** . If the script is not available, install it with:

~~~
apt install network-manager
~~~

More information at [network - nmcli](0501-inet-nm-cli_en.md#network-manager-command-line-tool)

Intel's [iNet wireless daemon](https://iwd.wiki.kernel.org/) (iwd) is sending the WPA supplicant into well-deserved retirement. Only one tenth as big and much faster, iwd will be the successor. In rare cases, connections are lost with iwd. It is then advisable to [return to the WPA supplicant](0502-inet-iwd_en.md#back-to-wpa_supplicant).

### Runlevels - target unit

By default, siduction boots into the graphical user interface (except NoX).  
Configuration of runlevels is described in the chapter [siduction runlevels - target unit](0714-systemd-target_en.md#systemd-target---target-unit).

### Other desktop environments

Plasma, Gnome, Xfce, LXQt, Cinnamon, and Xorg are shipped by siduction.

### Help in IRC and in the forum

Help is always available in IRC or in the siduction forum.
